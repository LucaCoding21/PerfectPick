To use it, you during champion selection phase and enter your enemy laners champion in the search bar. It will then output the 3 best picks to choose to gain the advantage in lane. 

__Technologies Used__ <br />
This project utilized a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to create a dynamic web experience. On the front-end, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were employed to design and implement interactive features, ensuring an engaging user interface. Leveraging these technologies allowed for seamless navigation and visually appealing presentation of content.

To populate the website with relevant information, a Python script was crafted to scrape data from external sources. This script utilized the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to fetch and parse data from web pages. Upon extracting the desired information, the script organized it into a structured format, exporting it to a JSON file.

This JSON file serves as a centralized repository of data, accessible to the front-end through HTTP GET responses. By establishing this communication between the back-end Python script and the front-end web interface, the website can dynamically retrieve and display up-to-date information to users, enhancing their overall experience.
